### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Blender Python and Python for RaspberryPi
- Iâ€™m interested in StarTrek, StarGate and Blender

Thats what I am currently Working on:
- [ ] Creating an Stargate-Creator Addon (SGG) for Blender 3.0
- [ ] Learning how the Blender CustomNodes-PythonTemplate works
- [ ] Transform my [`Blender Better Render Addon`](https://github.com/heschy/Blender-Configuration-Skript/) into an Addon for Blender 3.0
